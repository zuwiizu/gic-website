# University creates inclusive campus through cultural competency programme

## The Challenge

A mid-sized university with approximately 15,000 students was facing significant challenges with campus climate and student retention. Despite efforts to increase diversity in admissions, the institution struggled with:

- **Frequent bias incidents** reported across campus
- **Low retention rates** among students from underrepresented backgrounds
- **Declining satisfaction scores** in campus climate surveys
- **Faculty and staff** feeling unprepared to support diverse student populations
- **Limited resources** for addressing cultural conflicts and misunderstandings

The university's leadership recognized that surface-level diversity initiatives weren't enough—they needed a comprehensive approach to create genuine inclusion and belonging.

## Our Approach

Global Insights Collective partnered with the university to implement a three-phase transformation strategy:

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Assessment (Months 1-2)

We began with a thorough evaluation of the current campus climate:

- **Campus-wide surveys** reaching 3,200 students, 450 faculty, and 280 staff members
- **Focus groups** with students from underrepresented communities
- **Analysis of incident reports** and disciplinary data from the previous three years
- **Policy review** of existing diversity and inclusion initiatives
- **Stakeholder interviews** with key administrators and student leaders

**Key findings:**
- 68% of underrepresented students reported experiencing bias or discrimination
- Faculty felt underprepared to address cultural issues in the classroom
- Existing support services were underutilized due to lack of awareness
- Incident response protocols were inconsistent and often inadequate

### Phase 2: Targeted Training and Development (Months 3-8)

Based on assessment findings, we designed and delivered customized training programs:

#### Leadership Development
- **Executive coaching** for senior administrators on inclusive leadership
- **Department chair training** on creating inclusive academic environments
- **Student affairs leadership** development on crisis response and support

#### Faculty Development
- **Inclusive pedagogy workshops** for 200+ faculty members
- **Bias awareness training** integrated into new faculty orientation
- **Curriculum review** support for incorporating diverse perspectives
- **Classroom management** strategies for addressing bias incidents

#### Staff Training
- **Cultural competency training** for all student-facing staff
- **Crisis intervention** protocols for residence life and student services
- **Inclusive communication** workshops for administrative staff

#### Student Programming
- **Peer educator training** for 50 student leaders
- **Bystander intervention** workshops for the broader student body
- **Cultural celebration** and dialogue events
- **Mentoring program** connecting upperclassmen with first-year students

### Phase 3: Implementation and Sustainability (Months 9-12)

We supported the university in embedding new practices and measuring progress:

- **Policy updates** to reflect inclusive practices
- **Ongoing coaching** for key personnel
- **Progress monitoring** through quarterly surveys and data analysis
- **Continuous improvement** based on feedback and outcomes
- **Sustainability planning** for long-term success

## Measurable Results

Within one academic year, the university achieved significant improvements:

### Incident Reduction
- **45% decrease** in reported bias incidents
- **60% improvement** in incident response satisfaction
- **Faster resolution times** for cultural conflicts

### Student Experience
- **27% increase** in overall student satisfaction scores
- **15% improvement** in retention rates for underrepresented students
- **35% increase** in utilization of support services
- **Improved sense of belonging** across all demographic groups

### Faculty and Staff Development
- **90% of faculty** reported increased confidence in addressing cultural issues
- **85% of staff** felt better equipped to support diverse students
- **Reduced turnover** among faculty of color

### Campus Culture
- **Increased participation** in diversity programming
- **More inclusive campus events** and activities
- **Stronger cross-cultural relationships** among students
- **Enhanced reputation** for inclusion and belonging

## What Made the Difference

Several key factors contributed to the program's success:

### 1. Leadership Commitment
The university's senior leadership demonstrated genuine commitment to change, providing necessary resources and holding departments accountable for progress.

### 2. Data-Driven Approach
Regular assessment and feedback loops allowed for continuous improvement and demonstrated concrete progress to stakeholders.

### 3. Comprehensive Strategy
Rather than isolated initiatives, the program addressed systemic issues across all levels of the institution.

### 4. Community Engagement
Students, faculty, and staff were active participants in designing and implementing solutions, ensuring buy-in and sustainability.

### 5. Cultural Responsiveness
Training and interventions were tailored to the specific needs and context of the university community.

## Lessons Learned

The transformation process revealed several important insights:

- **Change takes time**: Meaningful cultural change requires sustained effort over multiple years
- **Training alone isn't enough**: Policies, procedures, and accountability measures must support behavioral change
- **Student voice is crucial**: Centering student experiences and feedback drives more effective solutions
- **Intersectionality matters**: Programs must address the complex, overlapping identities of community members

## Sustainability and Next Steps

To maintain momentum, the university has:

- **Institutionalized training** as part of onboarding for all new employees
- **Established ongoing assessment** protocols to monitor progress
- **Created dedicated funding** for inclusion initiatives
- **Developed internal capacity** to continue the work independently
- **Expanded partnerships** with community organizations
