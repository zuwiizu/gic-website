        Our cultural competency training equips faculty, staff and students with the skills to navigate cultural differences, understand bias and cultivate inclusive environments. Through interactive workshops and practical exercises, participants build empathy, enhance communication and develop strategies to promote belonging across campus or workplace settings.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
        Training modules cover topics such as cultural awareness, intersectionality, microaggressions and allyship. Programmes can be tailored for general audiences or specific departments and include pre‑ and post‑assessment to measure growth and impact.
