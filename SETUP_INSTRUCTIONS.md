# Setup Instructions for Global Insights Collective Website

## üñºÔ∏è Logo Setup

1. **Save Ismail's photo** as `/public/team/ismail-warsame.jpg`
2. **Save the GIC logo** as `/public/logo.png`
3. **Save the globe icon** (optional) as `/public/logo-icon.png`

The website is already configured to use these file paths.

## üì∫ YouTube Video Integration

### Current Video Placeholders
The website currently uses placeholder video IDs (`dQw4w9WgXcQ`). Replace these with actual video IDs from the Global Nomad channel:

**Files to update:**
- `app/speaking/page.tsx` (lines 100-115)
- `app/page.tsx` (line 34)

### How to get YouTube Video IDs:
1. Go to the video on YouTube
2. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123DEF456`)
3. The video ID is the part after `v=` (e.g., `ABC123DEF456`)

### Example Update:
```typescript
const featuredVideos = [
  {
    id: "YOUR_ACTUAL_VIDEO_ID", // Replace this
    title: "Building Inclusive Communities: A Global Perspective",
    description: "Ismail Warsame discusses strategies for creating inclusive environments..."
  }
];
```
